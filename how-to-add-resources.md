## 🎯 Adding Resources to OSWH

### Step 1: Choose a Resource File

1. Navigate to the `pages` directory in the repository
2. Select an `.md` file that matches your resource category
   - Example: `web-development-resources.md`, `AI-resources.md`, `devops-resources.md`

### Step 2: Check File Content

#### If the file is blank or needs a new section:

Add a main heading and table structure:

```markdown
# Resource Category Name - 2025 Edition

## 🚀 Brief Description

---

## Section Name

| Description | Preview | Link to Get Started |
| :---------: | :-----: | :-----------------: |
```

#### If the file already has content:

Proceed to the appropriate section or create a new one if needed.

### Step 3: Add Your Resource

Follow this template to add resources:

#### For YouTube Videos:

```markdown
| 1. Course/Video Name | [![CourseName](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VIDEO_CODE/mqdefault.jpg "CourseName")](VIDEO_LINK "CourseName") | [Here you go](VIDEO_LINK) |
```

**How to find the video code:**
- For YouTube link: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dphagk4O5qA`
- The video code is: `dphagk4O5qA` (the 11-character code after `v=`)

#### For Website/Course Links:

```markdown
| 1. Resource Name | [![ResourceName](IMAGE_URL "ResourceName")](RESOURCE_LINK "ResourceName") | [Here you go](RESOURCE_LINK) |
```

### Step 4: Format Your Contribution

**Key Points:**
- Number resources sequentially (1., 2., 3., etc.)
- Use descriptive names for resources
- Ensure all links are working
- Add proper attribution to course creators
- Keep the table format consistent

**Example:**

```markdown
| 1. React Tutorial by freeCodeCamp | [![React](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bMknfKXIFA8/mqdefault.jpg "React")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8) | [Here you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8) |
```

- Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> (Windows/Linux)

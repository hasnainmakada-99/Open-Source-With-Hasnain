## A Step-by-Step Guide to Add Resources to OSWH

**Before you begin**, please ensure that you have read the `Contributing.md` file if this is your first time contributing to open source.

### Adding Resources to OSWH

1. Start by selecting an `.md` file from the *pages directory*. For example, let's choose `full-stack-blockchain-development.md`.

2. **If the file is blank**: If no one has contributed to the file yet, it will be blank. In this case, follow these steps:

   a. Add a main heading to the file by inserting the following line at the top:
      ```
      # Heading
      ```

   b. Create a table to add the resource information by inserting the following markdown:
      ```markdown
      | Description | Preview | Link to Get Started |
      | :---------: | :-----: | :-----------------: |
      ```

3. **If the file already has content**: If the file already contains resources added by previous contributors, skip step 2 and proceed to step 3.

4. Add the resources to the file by following this template:
   ```markdown
   | 1. CourseName | [![CourseName](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AddVideoCode/mqdefault.jpg "CourseName")](AddVideoLink "CourseName") | [Here you go](AddVideoLink) |

- Replace `CourseName` with the name of the course/resource.

- Replace `AddVideoCode` with the 11-character video code present at the end of the YouTube video link.

- Replace `AddVideoLink` with the actual URL to the resource.

> "Note: To find the video code, refer to the 11-digit/character code at the end of the YouTube video link. 

>For example, if the link is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dphagk4O5qA, The video code is dphagk405qA."

5. If you are using VS Code Editor, you can preview the markdown by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> to ensure the formatting is correct.

Congratulations! You're halfway there to making your first contribution to Open-Source-With-Hasnain! 🙌🏼

Once you have finished adding the resources, return to the Contributing.md file and continue with the remaining steps (starting from step 7).

# Hacktoberfest 2023 Participation Guide üåü

Welcome to the Hacktoberfest 2023 event, a pivotal juncture for individuals embarking on their open-source journey. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer, this is your opportunity to contribute to open-source projects, fostering collaboration and expanding your network. üöÄ

This year, we're excited to announce that Open-Source-with-Hasnain will be participating as an individual project in Hacktoberfest. This guide will provide you with comprehensive insights into our participation process.

For detailed information about Hacktoberfest, kindly refer to the official [Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.co).

## Project Overview üìö

Open Source with Hasnain is dedicated to providing learning resources catering to beginner to intermediate developers across various tech stacks. In this year's Hacktoberfest, our project will feature two distinct segments:

1. **Low-Code / No-Code** üß©
2. **Coding and Development** üíª

The Low-Code section involves the existing project framework, built with [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/). If you're inclined towards non-coding contributions, this is the ideal avenue for you.

Conversely, the Coding section focuses on our [`dev`](https://github.com/hasnainmakada-99/Open-Source-With-Hasnain/tree/dev) branch, where we're orchestrating the migration of our project to React. We welcome contributions from beginners in any capacity during this migration phase.

The resources compiled within the docsify framework will seamlessly transition into the React migration. Once the migration concludes, the project will exclusively operate on the React platform, and the docsify build will be archived.

## Hacktoberfest 2023 Guidelines üìú

Before engaging in contributions, please acquaint yourself with the following guidelines:

1. **Strict Monitoring**: Our repository's resources are vigilantly monitored. Any contributors found spamming the repository or flooding it with excessive resource submissions will be reported and subsequently banned.

2. **Contributing Instructions**: Familiarize yourself with the `contributing.md` file to ensure a seamless contribution process.

3. **Issue Tracker**: Explore the `issues` tab to identify listed issues. Avoid creating duplicates by verifying if your concern has already been addressed.

4. **Issue Assignment**: Issues will be allocated based on a first-come, first-served principle. Contributors are encouraged to promptly address assigned issues.

5. **Hacktoberfest Label**: During Hacktoberfest, focus your attention on issues marked with the `hacktoberfest` label.

6. **Positive Interaction**: Uphold a supportive and respectful attitude towards fellow contributors. At Open Source with Hasnain, fostering a collaborative environment is paramount.

7. **Seeking Assistance**: In case of difficulties, the maintainers are available on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/d3uzRXFG9h) to provide assistance and guidance.

## Embrace the Open Source Spirit üåê

We extend our warmest invitation to you to participate in this enriching open-source endeavor. Your contributions will not only shape this project but also contribute to your personal growth within the open-source community.
